# 🚀 360° Business Intelligence & Predictive Growth System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **360° Business Intelligence & Predictive Growth System** is a complete end-to-end analytics solution that integrates sales, marketing, and customer data into a unified intelligence framework.
This project simulates a real-world business environment and demonstrates how data can be transformed into actionable insights, predictive models, and executive-level dashboards.
The entire workflow is implemented in:
* 🐍 **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Full analytics
* 📊 **R (R Notebook)** – Statistical analysis & modeling
* 📈 **Excel** – KPI modeling & business simulations
* 📊 **Power BI** – Executive dashboards
* 📄 **Final PDF Report** – Complete business case documentation

# 🎯 Project Objective
To build a full-stack business intelligence system that:
* Cleans and processes raw business data
* Performs exploratory data analysis
* Builds predictive models (forecasting & churn)
* Calculates business KPIs
* Visualizes performance in dashboards
* Generates a structured executive-level report
This project demonstrates both technical depth and business understanding.
